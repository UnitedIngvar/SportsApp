# SportsApp
 This is a drill-like, training application. It's built upon the guidance provided by the "PRO ASP.NET Core" book by Adam Freeman.

This is a simple application that imitates the behavior of a Sports Store, where you can by products related to sport.
This project doesn't lac claim to being best-practice or whatever, rather, it contains an amalgam of different ASP.NET features to train on.
